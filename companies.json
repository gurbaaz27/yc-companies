        "long_description": "The journey of building the ecosystem from scratch started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder)  were working on a crowdfunding portal project for India, they soon realized that most of the online payment gateway solutions were extremely cumbersome to get started on, especially for startups and SMEs. The company was surprised to see that the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. \r\n\r\nRazorpay enables payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for doing business.\r\n\r\nRazorpay\u2019s valuation jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling compliance, operations and more on growth.\r\n\r\nThis commitment to make lives simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made seven acquisitions over the course of time: \r\n\r\nAcquired Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading fintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.  RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation of a business\u2019s entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. \r\n\r\nCustomer has always been at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions:\r\n\r\n- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:\r\n\r\n- First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ \r\n- Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI\r\n- Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. \r\n- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay. \r\n",

                "value": "The journey of building the ecosystem from scratch started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder)  were working on a crowdfunding portal project for India, they soon realized that most of the online payment gateway solutions were extremely cumbersome to get started on, especially for startups and SMEs. The company was surprised to see that the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. \r\n\r\nRazorpay enables payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for doing business.\r\n\r\nRazorpay\u2019s valuation jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling compliance, operations and more on growth.\r\n\r\nThis commitment to make lives simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made seven acquisitions over the course of time: \r\n\r\nAcquired Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading fintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.  RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation of a business\u2019s entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. \r\n\r\nCustomer has always been at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions:\r\n\r\n- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:\r\n\r\n- First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ \r\n- Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI\r\n- Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. \r\n- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay. \r\n",

We're relentlessly mission driven and always put our customers first - from what products we chose to launch next to our transparency and use of simple language. With a Net Promoter Score of 70+, it shows. \r\n\r\nFrom our founding in 2015, we now have over 7 million customers in the UK (13% of UK adults) and are building out our team in the US. We've seen incredible organic growth, acquiring 150,000 customers / month in 2022, with 80% of this coming from word of mouth. Our weekly active user rate is ~60% and ~40% of our active users use us as their Main Bank account, showing that we are a product that is embedded in our users' daily lives. We've grown to ~2,450 staff (~400 of which make up the product/tech team), and are backed by YC, Stripe, Tencent, Mike Moritz, and others.\r\n\r\nInternally, we encourage an open, collaborative, and inclusive working environment - we were voted the #1 startup where people in the UK want to work for the second year running in 2022. We contribute to open source software, and we continually engage with our wonderful community. We're hiring talented, creative problem-solvers to help us build the bank of the future. Join us!",

Today, half of K-12 schools in the U.S. use Clever to give students and teachers single sign-on access for any resource or file they need, and to automate software account setup and updates for district administrators. Clever gives teachers time to teach, helps districts be better informed, and makes using applications in the classroom effortless.\r\n\r\nWe are a team of more than 100 people passionate about education.

Founded in 2012, Clever was started by educators and technology professionals who knew that schools, teachers, and students could all benefit from the amazing learning software that was available, but key challenges stood in the way of accessing the technology. Today, half of K-12 schools in the U.S. use Clever to give students and teachers single sign-on access for any resource or file they need, and to automate software account setup and updates for district administrators. Clever gives teachers time to teach, helps districts be better informed, and makes using applications in the classroom effortless.\r\n\r\nWe are a team of more than 100 people passionate about education.

As much as 60% of their sales happen on credit. That\u2019s ~24% of the country\u2019s GDP (500B$) lying on paper!\r\n\r\nOKCREDIT as a company came into existence to start solving the most important problem of credit recovery in MSMEs. We as first movers developed a bookkeeping app that would help any merchant sitting at the remotest corner of the country with internet connectivity to record his transactions digitally.

We offer online doctor\u2019s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).\r\n\r\nMore than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.\r\n\r\nOphelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.\r\n\r\nZack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor.

A pet ecosystem that combines On and offline platform where pet owners will find a solution for all their needs, including products & services. \r\nCurrently, to meet the needs of their pets, people must go to different places and platforms. To find products, they go to one place; for services, they go to several others; and for healthcare, a few more. In Colombia, in average, a person must visit or consult more than seven places per year to meet the needs of their pets.\r\n\r\nWe built a digital platform where users don\u2019t have to go anywhere else to meet said needs. With two main sections; products and services. In the products section, we have more than 4,000 references (among which you can find most of the brands of food, snacks, medicines, accessories and others). In the services section, we have more than 17 services, all the healthcare, beauty and entertainment services. All of the above delivered straight to your home and with the flexibility of choosing the date and time on and at which you wish to receive the order, including same-day deliveries for the main cities and accepting all payment methods, both online and cash on delivery.",

We look at a person\u2019s actual cancer cells, test combinations of FDA approved drugs, and see which combinations kill the cancer cells and leave the healthy cells alive. We focus on combinations because cancer is often difficult to target with just one drug and starting with a single drug can lead to resistant clones or relapse. We're building a highly automated lab in Foster City running on our custom software and are currently testing relapsed/refractory cancer patients as well as samples from a variety of pharma/biotech partnerships.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.notablelabs.com/careers",

This has several benefits: - Instant local testing - Portability: the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service. - Superior caching: every operation is cached by default, and caching works the same everywhere - Compatibility with the Docker ecosystem: if it runs in a container, you can add it to your pipeline. - Cross-language instrumentation: teams can use each other's tools without learning each other's language.",

In addition, the team made news when Cancer Physicians who sit on the committee for patient treatment guidelines (NCCN) presented a clinical study using Cofactor\u2019s technology showing superiority in predicting the patients who will respond to immunotherapy. This initial application is an acute problem recognized widely in the rapidly developing immunotherapy industry and represents north of a billion dollar TAM. \r\n\r\nAfter a number of recent key milestones, the team is taking the technology more broadly to 50% of cancers diagnosed in the US. \r\n\r\nCurrent investors include Menlo Ventures, DCVC, and Ascension Ventures (this last investor representing the funding arm for 13 National U.S. Healthcare Systems).",

In addition, the team made news when Cancer Physicians who sit on the committee for patient treatment guidelines (NCCN) presented a clinical study using Cofactor\u2019s technology showing superiority in predicting the patients who will respond to immunotherapy. This initial application is an acute problem recognized widely in the rapidly developing immunotherapy industry and represents north of a billion dollar TAM. \r\n\r\nAfter a number of recent key milestones, the team is taking the technology more broadly to 50% of cancers diagnosed in the US. \r\n\r\nCurrent investors include Menlo Ventures, DCVC, and Ascension Ventures (this last investor representing the funding arm for 13 National U.S. Healthcare Systems).",

When you book one of their recommendations, you\u2019ll get a discount from the business and they receive bonus credit to say thanks.\r\n\r\nThe Tab platform gives independent tourism businesses the tools to improve their online presence, be discovered, take direct bookings \u2014 and also to take payments. Our payment platform is uniquely designed for tourism businesses, handling over 100 currencies natively, and every payment type securely and easily.\r\n\r\nAs travel returns after a difficult period, it\u2019s time for a fresh approach. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building a social commerce platform for tourism \u2014 helping to spread the benefits of tourism far and wide, and helping travellers make the most of their precious time abroad. \r\n\r\nWe're headquartered in London, and backed by Y Combinator (the investors behind Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe).",

Today, Resolve helps bridge the communication gap between people who operate buildings and those who design and build them. We've built the most robust application for reviewing industrial facilities on wireless VR devices like the Oculus Quest - our customers love it because it just works even with complex 3D building models.\r\n\r\nFrom data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.\r\n\r\nOur customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured.",

Today, Resolve helps bridge the communication gap between people who operate buildings and those who design and build them. We've built the most robust application for reviewing industrial facilities on wireless VR devices like the Oculus Quest - our customers love it because it just works even with complex 3D building models.\r\n\r\nFrom data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.\r\n\r\nOur customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured.",

If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. \r\n\r\nWe also encourage you not to take our word for it. Read what Solo Practice University, the ABA Journal, FindLaw, AboveTheLaw, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, and others say about us. This isn't some fly-by-the-night company. This is the future of the legal industry. We hope you'll get in touch. \r\n\r\nLawdingo was started by Nikhil Nirmel (nikhil@lawdingo.com), an entrepreneur with a background at Yelp and Wharton Undergrad, and Dan Langevin , a ridiculously talented technologist who was formerly CTO of Lifebooker. Lawdingo has backing from Y Combinator and other investors.",

Post-pandemic, Britain's most treasured institution is in crisis. Patient satisfaction is at 25 year low and 1/7 staff are applying for Non-NHS jobs fuelling an 11% recruitment gap. \r\n\r\nBy digitising the 100s of repetitive processes in healthcare, Healthtech 1 will reverse the trend, and produce the world's most productive health care system.",

By building our fully digital workflows into the fabric of these new practices, we're improving efficiency and unlocking new healthcare delivery revenue streams (e.g. async care & group visits).",

We collect impressions about users by helping SMBs, mid-market to enterprise sales orgs adapt automated sales emails to their recipients. In addition to public data sources, we are the first to use domain specific knowledge in the sender\u2019s CRM to create high quality, reliable emails at scale that don\u2019t need human review.\r\n\r\nWe research prospects from 40+ web sources, including LinkedIn, Google, TechCrunch, Gartner, Crunchbase, etc., and organize domain-specific data from tools like 6sense, ZoomInfo, Clearbit, and your chosen CRM. Our AI creates individual personas for each prospect and customizes a personalized sales email campaign in your voice to address their pain points and preferred communication style. Strict guardrails ensure reliably high-quality output, ready to send with your sales enablement platforms (Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo, HubSpot, etc) without the need for additional review.\r\n\r\nInterested in trying it out today?

We connect to smart thermostats, HVAC systems, batteries and EV chargers to automatically lower consumption during peak times. \r\n\r\n\r\nElectrification is at the core of the UK\u2019s net zero strategy. However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand.  With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. \r\n\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.\r\n\r\nWe connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is leveraging energy flexibility, at mass-market scale to enable electrification of the energy system.",

                "value": "Elyos Energy helps companies save cost and reduce carbon emissions by shifting electricity consumption outside of peak demand. We connect to smart thermostats, HVAC systems, batteries and EV chargers to automatically lower consumption during peak times. \r\n\r\n\r\nElectrification is at the core of the UK\u2019s net zero strategy. However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand.  With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. \r\n\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.\r\n\r\nWe connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is leveraging energy flexibility, at mass-market scale to enable electrification of the energy system.",

We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n \r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.\r\n\r\nBy coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.\r\n\r\nBy using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.\r\n\r\nYuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.\r\n\r\nFinally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests.

Unless you\u2019re a big tech company or someone like Stitch Fix that can afford a platform team, staffing teams with high ratios of engineers, or finding unicorn data scientists that can build pipelines is your only option; it not only slows time to value, it makes operating ML/AI expensive. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re here to change that. Think simple python that enables a low software engineering bar to describe what should happen, and then with some extra metadata, generates the workflow code, and that also consolidates several MLOps tools into a single platform, all in a self-service manner.

Unless you\u2019re a big tech company or someone like Stitch Fix that can afford a platform team, staffing teams with high ratios of engineers, or finding unicorn data scientists that can build pipelines is your only option; it not only slows time to value, it makes operating ML/AI expensive. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re here to change that. Think simple python that enables a low software engineering bar to describe what should happen, and then with some extra metadata, generates the workflow code, and that also consolidates several MLOps tools into a single platform, all in a self-service manner. It\u2019s functional and usable by junior and senior folks alike.",

And they are not ready for online orders. Regulatory changes require pharmacies to take and fill e-prescriptions (roll-out Jan-23), but many have no way to do this online today. \r\n\r\nSanvivo uses technology to give local pharmacies digital superpowers, enabling them to combine fast supply and high-quality consultation with state of the are e-commerce solutions.",

We also bring instant demand through integrations with 3rd party consumer delivery companies.\r\n\r\nAlmost all pharmacies in Europe are, by law, local 1-person businesses. And they are not ready for online orders. Regulatory changes require pharmacies to take and fill e-prescriptions (roll-out Jan-23), but many have no way to do this online today. \r\n\r\nSanvivo uses technology to give local pharmacies digital superpowers, enabling them to combine fast supply and high-quality consultation with state of the are e-commerce solutions.",

Our Secure Chat UI and APIs provide audit logs on every interaction with external AI, allowing you to see what data has been shared with which providers and what Terms of Service or MSA's govern each one.\r\n3. We provide a wrapper around all the major providers of Large Language Models, so we can automatically direct your requests to the most appropriate AI for your particular request (based on data sensitivity, context window, cost, etc.)\r\n4. We get sensible MSA's in place with all major external providers, so your data cannot be retained for more than 30 days or used to train models.",

Our Secure Chat UI and APIs provide audit logs on every interaction with external AI, allowing you to see what data has been shared with which providers and what Terms of Service or MSA's govern each one.\r\n3. We provide a wrapper around all the major providers of Large Language Models, so we can automatically direct your requests to the most appropriate AI for your particular request (based on data sensitivity, context window, cost, etc.)\r\n4. We get sensible MSA's in place with all major external providers, so your data cannot be retained for more than 30 days or used to train models.",
